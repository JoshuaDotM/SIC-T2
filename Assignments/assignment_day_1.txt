Assignment 1 :
what happens if I add a x.txt file remotely to the repo and a y.txt file to the repo locally.
there are 2 cases :
1.you run git pull first
	.git fetches the remote changes(x.txt), merges it with your local changes(y.txt). 
	.git pull=git fetch (it first downloads the remote changes ) + git merge (merges it into its current branch)
	.The merge will be succesful as there is no conflicts ; two different files are added
	.now we run the 'git push' command to save the local changes in the remote repo
	.this is the safe and standard order
2.you run git push first
	.git sees your local repo is behind remote(it doesnt have the x.txt present in remote repo)
	.so the push cammand is rejected by default raising an error so you are forced to pull first.
